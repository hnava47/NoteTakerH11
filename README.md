## About The Project
This project is meant to enable note taking and saving them to a backend db.json file. This allows a user to store notes and reference them at a later time.

When the user clicks into the application, they are able to view the note taking page which allows them to create new notes.

![Create][create-note]

Once the user clicks the save button in the top right corner of the page, the note is saved to the backend db.json file and populates on the list of notes once the page is refreshed.
![Save][save-note]

The user also has the option to delete a note from the backend db.json file by clicking the associated delete button on the page.
